# Melbourne Urban Heat Model

This repository accompanies Episode 1 of the City Algorithms series.

It contains a machine learning model that predicts surface temperature across Melbourne suburbs using urban form attributes like vegetation cover, building density, and land use type.

## Files
- melbourne_heat_model.csv — Simulated dataset of Melbourne suburbs with UHI indicators
- [Notebook not included here — available on request]

## Features
- NDVI (vegetation cover)
- Impervious surface percentage
- Building density
- Land use type

## Output
Predicted surface temperature (°C) for each suburb.
